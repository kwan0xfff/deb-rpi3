# Overview

The purpose of this project is to utilize the Raspberry Pi 3
as a 64-bit flexible platform for experimentation.
Raspberry Pi is a family of boards dedicated to making digital
creativity accessible to people all over the world.

In contrast to previous boards of the Raspberry Pi family, which
used 32-bit processors, the Raspberry Pi 3 uses a 64-bit processor.
Specifically, it uses a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 architecture
implemented by a Broadcom BCM2837.
For this project, a 64-bit Linux kernel is combined with
a root filesystem built using Debian Stretch *arm64* packages.
With this foundation in place,
the board is can utilize the existing ecosystem of Debian arm64 packages.
